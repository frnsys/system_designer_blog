# The world is wicked

> We [as designers] face the difficulties of untangling messes (taming wicked problems) and fostering innovation (economic and social), which require understanding systems — which are complex, dynamic, and probabilistic—and “hidden” or “translucent”.

Hugh Dubberly makes the urgency for systems thinking in the field of design quite obvious in his 2015 essay, [A Systems Literacy Manifesto](http://www.dubberly.com/articles/a-systems-literacy-manifesto.html). 

## Our tool, System Designer, hopes to provide a way to make some of the ideas around the power and importance of systems, computer science, and cybernetics accessible to those in creative fields.

Design-school training is lacking, few of us leave our prestigious academies with any idea about the kinds of complex issues interlocked between politics, business, technology, and human and social behavior. As governments are realising the power of cultural capital and looking to [artists and activists to bridge gaps between their policy and audience](http://www.artnews.com/2015/07/13/tania-bruguera-to-be-first-artist-in-residence-for-new-york-city-mayors-office-of-immigrant-affairs/), and [startups are becoming lobbyists](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/23/technology/start-up-leaders-embrace-lobbying-as-part-of-the-job.html), it becomes even more imperative that we, as participants with power in this system, need better understanding of how we're contributing.

We're doing a series of writing around the designer's role in tackling and facing some of these issues, and will be adding interactive elements with live code in the coming months.
