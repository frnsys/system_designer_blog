To simulate and speculate is to be preemptive about designing for better and more anticipative visions of the future. To plan is to design. But as we can see with these wicked problems, oftentimes plans are short-sighted, reactionary, and ultimately result in vicious cycles instead of virtuous ones. Design-school training is lacking, few of us leave our prestigious academies with any idea about the kinds of complex issues interlocked between politics, business, technology, and human and social behavior. The industry is just beginning to encourage dialogue between professionals and the communities they are trying to serve. We must task ourselves to create our own tools for introspection and less extractive enterprises, and reinvest resources back into improving the system.
